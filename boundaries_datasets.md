# Boundaries and Geographic Datasets

## Administrative Boundary Datasets

1. **Constable Precincts**

   - **Source**: Harris County ITC
   - **Tags**: Harris County, boundary, constable, precincts, Official
   - **Categories**: Political, Government
   - **Potential Analysis**: Spatial analysis of law enforcement jurisdiction, demographic analysis by precinct, resource allocation optimization, service equity assessment

2. **Commissioner Precincts**
   - **Description**: Official Harris County commissioner precinct boundaries updated with 2020 census
   - **Type**: Feature Service
   - **Last Updated**: 1/12/2024

## Analytical Potential
These datasets offer potential for:
- Geospatial analysis of administrative boundaries and their relationship to demographics
- Correlation analysis between boundary types and various socioeconomic indicators
- Equity analysis of resource distribution across different administrative divisions
- Time-series analysis of boundary changes and their impacts (if historical data available)
- Predictive modeling for resource allocation and service optimization

## Data Quality Considerations
- Most datasets are recently updated (2024-2025), providing current information
- Geographic coverage is comprehensive for Harris County
- Official government sources ensure data reliability
- Boundaries align with census data, enabling integration with demographic information
- May need to be supplemented with additional datasets for more robust analysis (crime, health, economic indicators)
