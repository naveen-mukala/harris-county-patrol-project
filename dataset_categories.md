# Harris County Open Data Portal - Dataset Categories

The Harris County Open Data Portal provides several categories of datasets that can be used for data science and analytics projects. Here are the main categories identified:

1. **Boundaries** - Likely includes geographic boundaries, districts, precincts, etc.
2. **County Facilities** - Information about county buildings, offices, and other facilities
3. **Public Health** - Health-related datasets that could include disease statistics, healthcare facilities, etc.
4. **Public Safety** - Crime data, emergency services, law enforcement information
5. **Recreation** - Parks, recreational facilities, and related services
6. **Transportation** - Roads, public transit, traffic data, and transportation infrastructure

Additionally, there appears to be a Harris County Community Services Application that might contain socioeconomic data, community programs, and services information.

These categories offer rich potential for data science projects, particularly in areas like:
- Public health analysis and prediction
- Crime pattern analysis and prevention strategies
- Transportation optimization and traffic analysis
- Geographic analysis of county services and accessibility
- Socioeconomic analysis and community needs assessment

Next steps will involve exploring each category in detail to identify specific datasets with sufficient depth, quality, and relevance for a portfolio-worthy data science project.
