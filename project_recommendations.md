# Harris County Data Science Project - Dataset Analysis and Project Recommendations

After exploring the Harris County Open Data Portal, I've identified several high-value datasets that would make excellent foundations for a portfolio project. Below is an analysis of the most promising datasets and recommendations for potential project directions.

## Top Datasets by Category

### Public Health
- **Confirmed Mosquito Activity for Current Year**
  - Shows confirmed mosquito-borne disease activity
  - Potential for disease outbreak prediction and public health impact assessment
  - Geographic and temporal components enable spatial-temporal analysis

- **ULV Treatments: Proposed & Cumulative**
  - Shows mosquito control treatment areas
  - Enables analysis of public health intervention effectiveness
  - Can be paired with mosquito activity data for comprehensive analysis

### Public Safety
- **Harris County Patrol Contracts**
  - Contains patrol district and contract information for law enforcement
  - Enables resource allocation analysis and service equity assessment
  - Last updated in 2021, providing relatively recent data

- **Constable's Office Command, District and Station Locations**
  - Shows geographic distribution of law enforcement resources
  - Potential for response time optimization and accessibility analysis
  - Can be integrated with demographic data for equity analysis

### Boundaries and Geographic Data
- **Constable Precincts**
  - Recently updated (2025) administrative boundaries
  - Enables demographic analysis by precinct and resource allocation studies
  - High-quality official government data

- **Commissioner Precincts**
  - Updated with 2020 census data
  - Allows for political representation and budget allocation analysis
  - Can reveal patterns in infrastructure investment and service equity

- **Harris County Zipcodes**
  - Fundamental geographic unit for socioeconomic analysis
  - Enables integration with external datasets (health, economic, demographic)
  - Supports neighborhood-level analysis and visualization

## Recommended Project Directions

Based on the available datasets, I recommend the following project directions that would showcase data science skills while addressing relevant problems for Harris County:

### 1. Public Health Risk Assessment and Intervention Optimization
**Datasets**: Mosquito Activity + ULV Treatments + Zipcodes/Boundaries
**Objective**: Develop a predictive model for mosquito-borne disease risk and optimize intervention strategies.
**Key Components**:
- Spatial-temporal analysis of disease vectors
- Effectiveness evaluation of current treatment strategies
- Predictive modeling for outbreak prevention
- Resource optimization for public health interventions
- Interactive dashboard for risk visualization

### 2. Law Enforcement Resource Allocation and Service Equity Analysis
**Datasets**: Patrol Contracts + Constable Locations + Commissioner/Constable Precincts
**Objective**: Analyze the distribution of law enforcement resources and identify opportunities for optimization.
**Key Components**:
- Geographic analysis of service coverage
- Response time modeling and optimization
- Demographic analysis of service equity
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Interactive visualization of coverage and gaps

### 3. Socioeconomic Analysis and Public Service Accessibility
**Datasets**: Commissioner Precincts + Zipcodes + County Facilities (if available)
**Objective**: Assess the relationship between administrative boundaries, demographics, and access to public services.
**Key Components**:
- Demographic profiling by administrative district
- Service accessibility scoring and gap analysis
- Equity assessment across different geographic units
- Recommendations for service improvement
- Interactive dashboard for community planning

## Recommendation for Portfolio Project

For a data science/analyst position at Harris County, I recommend pursuing the **Law Enforcement Resource Allocation and Service Equity Analysis** project for these reasons:

1. **Relevance**: Public safety is a core function of county government
2. **Data Quality**: The law enforcement datasets are well-maintained and comprehensive
3. **Skill Showcase**: Demonstrates spatial analysis, statistical modeling, and optimization techniques
4. **Impact Potential**: Findings could directly inform resource allocation decisions
5. **Visual Appeal**: Geographic data lends itself to compelling visualizations
6. **End-to-End Solution**: Combines descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics

This project would demonstrate your ability to extract insights from government data and provide actionable recommendations that could improve public safety service delivery in Harris County.
