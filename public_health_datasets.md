# Public Health Datasets

## Mosquito Control and Vector-Borne Disease Datasets

1. **ULV Treatments: Proposed & Cumulative (Current Year)**
   - **Description**: Shows proposed and cumulative ultra low volume treatment (ULV) mosquito control areas throughout Harris County
   - **Type**: Web Mapping Application
   - **Last Updated**: 5/22/2020
   - **Created**: 6/11/2018
   - **Tags**: Mosquito Control, ULV Treatments
   - **Potential Analysis**: Spatial analysis of mosquito control efforts, effectiveness analysis, time-series analysis of treatment patterns

2. **Confirmed Mosquito Activity for Current Year**
   - **Description**: Shows confirmed mosquito-borne disease activity for the current year
   - **Type**: Web Mapping Application
   - **Last Updated**: 5/22/2020
   - **Created**: 6/11/2018
   - **Tags**: Confirmed Mosquito Activity, Harris County Public Health
   - **Potential Analysis**: Disease outbreak prediction, hotspot identification, correlation with environmental factors, public health impact assessment

## Analytical Potential
These datasets offer potential for:
- Geospatial analysis of disease vectors and control measures
- Time-series analysis of disease activity patterns
- Predictive modeling for outbreak prevention
- Effectiveness evaluation of public health interventions
- Correlation analysis with environmental and demographic factors

## Data Quality Considerations
- Last update was in 2020, may need to check for more recent data
- Need to evaluate data completeness and granularity
- Geographic coverage appears to be comprehensive for Harris County
- May need to be supplemented with weather/climate data for more robust analysis
